# String Manipulation with Pointers - Code Explanation

This program demonstrates working with strings using pointers in C. The `string_length()` function calculates the length of a string by using a pointer to traverse each character until it reaches the null terminator `'\0'`, incrementing a counter with each iteration. In `main()`, a string "This is a sample text string" is declared and printed normally. Then, a pointer is used to traverse the string character by character, printing each character with `*ptr++`, which dereferences the pointer to get the current character and then increments the pointer to move to the next character. Finally, the custom `string_length()` function is called to calculate and display the string's length, demonstrating how pointers can efficiently traverse and manipulate strings without array indexing.
