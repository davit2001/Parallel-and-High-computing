First, it creates an integer variable a with value 100 and a pointer that stores the address of a.
Then it prints the memory address of a using two methods: directly with the & operator and through the pointer variable, showing both give the same address.
Next, it modifies the value of a indirectly by dereferencing the pointer and assigning a new value (120).
Finally, it prints the updated value through the pointer to confirm the modification worked.
The program shows how pointers can store addresses, access those addresses, and modify values indirectly.
