It creates three threads that all run simultaneously, each printing a message to identify itself along with its system-assigned thread ID. Since the threads run concurrently, the order in which they print may vary each time the program runs. The main thread doesn't just exit immediately — it waits for all three threads to complete using pthread_join, ensuring a clean and orderly shutdown of the program.
