The solution divides the array into equal chunks and assigns one chunk per thread. Each thread searches for the maximum value in its own chunk and returns it via a heap-allocated pointer. Once all threads finish, the main thread collects each partial maximum through pthread_join and compares them to find the global maximum. Execution time is measured for both the sequential and parallel versions to compare performance.
