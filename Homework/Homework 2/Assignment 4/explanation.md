The solution counts prime numbers from 1 to 20 million both sequentially and in parallel. The is_prime function checks each number by testing divisibility up to its square root. In the parallel version, the range is divided into equal chunks and each thread independently counts primes in its chunk, returning the result to the main thread, which adds them all together for the final count. Since each number is checked independently, no synchronization between threads is needed.
