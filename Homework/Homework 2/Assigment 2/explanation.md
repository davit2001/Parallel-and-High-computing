The solution splits the array into equal chunks and assigns one chunk per thread. Each thread independently computes the sum of its chunk and returns the result via a heap-allocated pointer. The main thread collects all partial sums through pthread_join and adds them together for the final result. This approach avoids any shared memory or synchronization between threads, making it safe and efficient. Execution time is measured for both the sequential and parallel versions using clock_gettime so the speedup can be compared.
